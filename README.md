The intent of this project, first and foremost, is to provide accessible tools to make learning and understanding in an academic setting easier. 
The intent is __not__ to promote academic dishonesty in any way, shape, or form. 
This project is meant to help students understand the intricacies of the content being taught and how to answer in a way that not only demonstrates their understanding, but also respond appropriately in accordance with the instructor's expectations. Simply, this project is a tool to narrow the gap between genuine understanding and the graded performance.
